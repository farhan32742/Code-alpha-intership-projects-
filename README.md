Titanic Survival Prediction <br>
project done by FARHAN FAYAZ   
Project Overview

In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset to predict survival rates of passengers based on various attributes like age, gender, class, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, I trained a model to identify key factors influencing survival. This project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical variables
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset
- Model Training: Train and evaluate four different machine learning models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - Gradient Boosting Algorithm
- Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy.

Tools and Libraries

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Repository Structure

- `data`: Contains the Titanic dataset
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation
- `models`: Contains saved models for each algorithm
- `visualizations`: Contains visualizations of the data and model performance

How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory
